# Product Requirements Document: Modern Todo Application

## 1. Product Overview

A full-stack todo application with a unique, slick interface that provides essential task management capabilities with drag-and-drop reordering, robust search/filtering, and archiving functionality. Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and CockroachDB.

### Vision

Create an intuitive, fast, and visually distinctive todo app that handles the basics exceptionally well while providing thoughtful quality-of-life features that reduce friction in daily task management.

### Target Users

- Individual users managing personal tasks
- Professionals tracking work items
- Anyone seeking a clean, efficient alternative to existing todo apps

## 2. Core User Stories

**Must-Have (MVP)**

- As a user, I want to create todos with a title and description so I can capture tasks with context
- As a user, I want to check off completed todos so I can track my progress
- As a user, I want to edit existing todos so I can update task details as they evolve
- As a user, I want to delete todos so I can remove tasks that are no longer relevant
- As a user, I want to drag and drop todos to reorder them so I can manually prioritize my work
- As a user, I want to search and filter my todos so I can quickly find specific tasks
- As a user, I want to archive completed todos so I can maintain a clean active list while preserving history

**Nice-to-Have (Future Phases)**

- As a user, I want to assign priority levels to todos so I can identify urgent tasks at a glance
- As a user, I want a focus mode that highlights only my current task so I can minimize distractions
- As a user, I want quick capture functionality so I can add todos instantly without breaking my flow
- As a user, I want to tag tasks by energy level required so I can match tasks to my current state
- As a user, I want to break down todos into subtasks so I can manage complex projects

## 3. Feature Requirements

#### Energy-Based Sorting

- Tag system: High Energy / Medium Energy / Low Energy
- UI selector when creating/editing todo
- Filter: "Show me Low Energy tasks"
- Visual icons (âš¡ battery-style indicators)
- Implementation: simply a tag/category field with predefined values

#### Subtasks

- Parent todo only completes when all subtasks complete (optional)

## 4. Technical Requirements

### 4.1 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router), React 18+, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: CockroachDB Serverless (cloud-hosted)
- **ORM**: Prisma or Drizzle ORM (recommend Drizzle for better type safety)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended) or similar platform

### 4.2 Database Schema (MVP)

```
Table: todos
- id (UUID, primary key)
- title (VARCHAR(200), required)
- description (TEXT, nullable)
- completed (BOOLEAN, default false)
- archived (BOOLEAN, default false)
- position (INTEGER or FLOAT, for ordering)
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
- completed_at (TIMESTAMP, nullable)
```

### 4.3 API Endpoints (MVP)

```
GET    /api/todos              - List all todos (with query params for filters)
POST   /api/todos              - Create new todo
GET    /api/todos/[id]         - Get single todo
PATCH  /api/todos/[id]         - Update todo (title, description, completed, archived, position)
DELETE /api/todos/[id]         - Delete todo
POST   /api/todos/reorder      - Batch update positions after drag-and-drop
```

### 4.4 Performance Requirements

- Initial page load: < 1 second
- Todo creation: < 200ms perceived (optimistic UI)
- Search results: < 100ms
- Drag-and-drop: 60fps animations
- Database queries: < 100ms (indexed searches)

### 4.5 UI/UX Requirements

**Unique Interface Elements**

- Custom animations for todo completion (not just strikethrough)
- Gradient backgrounds or glassmorphism effects
- Micro-interactions (hover states, transitions)
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

**Accessibility**

- Keyboard navigation for all actions
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Focus indicators
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards

## 5. Success Metrics

**User Engagement**

- Daily active users
- Average todos created per user per day
- Average session duration

**Feature Usage**

- % of users who use search/filter
- % of users who use drag-and-drop reordering
- % of users who archive todos
- Completion rate (todos completed / todos created)

**Technical Performance**

- Average API response time
- Error rate
- Page load time (P50, P95)

## 6. Out of Scope (for MVP)

- User authentication / multi-user support (single-user app initially)
- Collaboration features
- Mobile native apps (web-only)
- Third-party integrations (calendar, email, etc.)
- Recurring todos
- Reminders/notifications
- Data export
- Themes/customization options

## 7. Future Considerations

**Phase 2** (Post-MVP)

- Priority levels
- Focus mode
- Quick capture

**Phase 3** (Long-term)

- User authentication
- Energy-based sorting
- Subtasks
- Recurring todos
- Mobile apps
- Data export/import

## 8. Design Decisions

1. **Completed todos**: Remain in active view with strikethrough and automatically move to bottom of list
2. **Archive**: Manual only - no auto-archiving functionality
3. **Authentication**: Single-user application, no auth required for MVP
4. **Drag-and-drop**: Works within active and archived sections independently
5. **Display limit**: 200 todos before pagination (if needed)

## 9. Open Questions

1. Should there be an "undo" history for bulk actions?
2. Should drag-and-drop allow moving items between active/archived sections?

## 9. Design Inspiration

Consider exploring:

- Linear's clean, minimal interface
- Notion's smooth interactions
- Things 3's thoughtful details
- Todoist's keyboard-first approach

The goal is to create something that feels **fast**, **smooth**, and **uniquely yours**.
